This project is my first project while working through The Odin Project curriculum.

From The Odin Project's [Curriculum] (http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

Completed project taught me proper git procedures as well as basic html and css in order to recreate (as best as possible to the eye...) the Google Search page.  I recreated my own view of the page, with my own image etc. so it is a visual representation of how the Google Search page looked on the day I began this assignment.
